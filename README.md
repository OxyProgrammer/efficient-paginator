# 📚 Client-Side Paginator with TypeScript Generics 🚀

Welcome to the Client-Side Paginator project! This application demonstrates an efficient client-side pagination solution built using **Next.js 15** and **TypeScript**. The project utilizes server actions to simulate backend database calls, implementing effective caching strategies and abstracting pagination logic into a reusable TypeScript class. ✨

## 🎯 Features

- **Client-Side Pagination**: Load and display data in manageable chunks.
- **TypeScript Generics**: Enhance reusability and type safety.
- **Client-Side Caching**: Speed up data access using caching mechanisms.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean and organized code structure for better maintainability.
